## History
South Indian Coffee, also known as filter coffee, has a rich history that dates back to the 17th century. It was introduced to India by Baba Budan, a Sufi saint, who smuggled seven coffee beans from Yemen and planted them in the hills of Chikmagalur, Karnataka. Since then, coffee cultivation and consumption have become an integral part of South Indian culture.

## Preparation Methods
South Indian Coffee is traditionally prepared using a metal filter, which consists of two cylindrical compartments. The upper compartment holds the coffee grounds, while the lower compartment collects the brewed coffee. Hot water is poured over the coffee grounds, and the brewed coffee slowly drips into the lower compartment. The resulting coffee is then mixed with hot milk and sugar before serving.

## Cultural Significance
South Indian Coffee holds a special place in the hearts of South Indians. It is not just a beverage but a symbol of hospitality and warmth. Serving a cup of filter coffee to guests is a common practice in South Indian households. The aroma and taste of freshly brewed filter coffee evoke a sense of nostalgia and comfort for many.
